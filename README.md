# RL Baselines
### Will Maclean

Framework for easily testing different algorithms on Gym environments. Multiple different agents currently implemented.

Todo:
- argparse for hyperparams (useful for wandb sweeps)
- write configs for all algorithms
- more algorithms!

Contributions welcome and encouraged.

Healthy amounts of inspiration taken from:
- Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms with PyTorch (https://github.com/p-christ/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-PyTorch)
