# RL Baselines
### Will Maclean

Framework for easily testing different algorithms on Gym environments. Multiple different agents currently implemented.

Currently Implemented algorithms:
- DQN Based
  - DQN
  - Rainbow DQN (partial implementation)
- Policy Gradient
  - None so far
- Actor Critic
  - SAC
  - Discrete SAC

Todo:
- argparse for hyperparams (useful for wandb sweeps)
- write configs for all algorithms
- more algorithms!
- venv specifications
- random seeding

Contributions welcome and encouraged.
